## 🌼 About Me
I'm Claire, and I finished my sophomore year at Miami University majoring in computer engineering and electrical engineering with a minor in computer science. I'm from Brentwood, TN, but I was born in Green Bay, WI, so I always say I went north for college because I missed the cold. May I say, I definitely experience the cold at school and it is nothing like I was used to in Brentwood. 
<br><br>
I didn't start coding until my senior year of high school when I took AP Computer Science Principles because I heard it was an easy class to get good credit in and I had space in my schedule. Little did I know that I would have so much passion for coding and eventually study it in college! I learned and became sufficient with Javascript during my first year of coding, but since then I have learned and practiced with many different programming lagunages. My main languages are Java, C++, and Verilog, and I am currently working to become sufficient in VHDL. Alongside programming, I also really enjoy physics and the hardware side of technology, so I thought computer engineering was the perfect way to combine all of the different topics I enjoy. I'm very excited to take a multitude of relavent classes through [Miami University's College of Engineering and Computing](https://www.miamioh.edu/cec/) and expand my knowledge.
<br><br>
During the summer of 2022, I researched, planned, and built a computer, and this personal project verified my passion for the electrical side of computer engineering, as well. Then, during the winter of 2022, I did the same process to build a keyboard, and this keyboard is the best thing ever (75% FTW). 
<br><br>
This summer, summer of 2023, I am working as an electrical engineer intern at Cryptic Vector, and I know this internship will teach me many new skills and show me what it is like to work in the contracting engineering industry.
