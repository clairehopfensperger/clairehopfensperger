## üåº About Me
I'm Claire, and I'm in my junior year at Miami University majoring in computer engineering and electrical engineering with a minor in computer science. I'm from Brentwood, TN, but I was born in Green Bay, WI, so I always say I went north for college because I missed the cold. May I say, I definitely experience the cold at school and it is nothing like I was used to in Brentwood. 
<br><br>
I didn't start coding until my senior year of high school when I took AP Computer Science Principles because I heard it was an easy class to get good credit in and I had space in my schedule. Little did I know that I would have so much passion for coding and eventually study it in college! I learned and became sufficient with Javascript during my first year of coding, but since then I have learned and practiced with many different programming lagunages. My main languages are C++, Verilog, and VHDL. Alongside programming, I also really enjoy physics and the hardware side of technology, so I thought computer engineering was the perfect way to combine all of the different topics I enjoy. I'm very excited to take a multitude of relavent classes through [Miami University's College of Engineering and Computing](https://www.miamioh.edu/cec/) and expand my knowledge.
<br><br>
During the summer of 2022, I researched, planned, and built a computer, and this personal project verified my passion for the electrical side of computer engineering, as well. Then, during the winter of 2022, I did the same process to build a keyboard, and this keyboard is the best thing ever (75% FTW). 
<br><br>
During the summer of 2023, I worked as an electrical engineer intern at Cryptic Vector, and this internship taught me many new skills and showed me what it was like to work in the contracting engineering industry.
